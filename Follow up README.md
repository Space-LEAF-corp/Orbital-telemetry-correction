# Orbital Telemetry Correction

A lineage-safe, open-source framework that reframes scattering phase shifts as orbital telemetry, helping isolate resonances and potential new states.

## What it does
- Estimates partial-wave phase shifts via WKB-like integrals.
- Computes Wigner time delays to flag quasi-bound behavior.
- Builds angular distributions (dσ/dΩ) from phase data.
- Highlights candidate resonances with a simple detector.

## Install
```bash
pip install -e .
this was all done from my phone i was only trying to figure something out and stumbled onto this discovery please dont be mad at me
